# Payloads

This folder contains configurations of the game's entities (kinda).

Like what item qualities exist and how common they are.
Or what field types belong to a specfic biome, how they affect energy
consumption and action points, and so on.

Some files are defined as json and some are good ol' csv.
Csv is great when using flat list items. Eventually they will all be ported to json,
because only a minority of them contain flat items and parsing separated strings within
a csv field is somewhat hacky...
