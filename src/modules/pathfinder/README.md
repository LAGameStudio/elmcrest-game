# Pathfinder

This module implements a basic A*-Pathfinding algorithm that works with nodes
that have six neighbors (e.g. a hexagon) by default.<br>
It should be usable with a wide variety of grids though, since the number of
neighbors and other characteristics can be modified.

This module has been built to run in a WebWorker.
