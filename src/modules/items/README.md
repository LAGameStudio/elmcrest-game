# Items

This module implements item templates and item "instances", that can receive
a number of affixes based on their quality.<br>
Affixes contain attribute bonuses and they are split into prefixes and suffixes.<br>
That way occurences of specific bonuses are easier to balance per item.
By assigning names to affixes you also get fancy item names, like
*"Raging Greatsword of Death"*.

Most of the item generation process in this module is inspired by guides and tutorials of the item
system in Diablo (1+2).
See this [Item Generation Tutorial](https://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Item_Generation_Tutorial) for more information.
