# Elmcrest

Elmcrest is the working title of a turn-based, adventure/role-playing game where
the player explores a procedurally generated world.

The game is built with HTML5 and lots of JavaScript.

**This is still a very early development feature demo.<br>
This version lacks content and therefore is not really playable by now.**

This repo does not necessarily represent the current state of development.<br>
Progress may be updated from time to time.

## ðŸ•¹ Run / build the game

Install dependencies with `yarn install`.

Start the development mode with `yarn run start`.

Make a build with `yarn run build`.<br>
To run the production build in your browser, you need something like `http-server ./build`.

**Use latest Chrome browser!**

## ðŸ“š Used libraries

- Redux for state management and game logic
- React for game UI
- Pixi.js for rendering of game world
- RxJS for action-based subscriptions between game modules

### Why?

This thing started out as a learning project for Redux, but grew into something bigger
after a couple of months. One reason is, that using Redux and React for a game like this
is pretty fun in my opinion. Another reason is, that even after a year of working on it
as a side project, it stayed quite maintainable and most things just worked out as
intended.<br>
However, **world performance is an issue** I have yet to figure out how to do it right/fast.
It just works in the first place! ðŸ˜…

## ðŸ“‚ Project structure

### `/assets`

Contains all types of game contents:
- Configurations (e.g. field types, skill parameters, item qualities, ...)
- Scripts (e.g. events, skills, locales, ...)
- Textures

### `/modules`

Contains the core game logic, bundled by features.<br>
More information on module structure can be found in [modules/README.md](./src/modules).

### `/scripts` (deprecated)

### `/setup`

Contains the setup scripts that load configuration files from `assets/` and
transform them into the game state.

### `/styles`

Contains global SCSS mixins, variables and styling for the UI.

### `/views`

Contains the game UI. This is React components land.
